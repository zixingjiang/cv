# Academic CV
This repo contains [Zixing Jiang](https://www.zixingjiang.com/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**, you can preview the CV as a [PDF](https://www.zixingjiang.com/files/cv-zxjiang.pdf). 

**Credit:** This CV is adapted from [Geoff Boeing's CV](https://github.com/gboeing/cv).

## Workflow
The CV's TeX file is *automatically compiled* to PDF and published to [zixingjiang.github.io](https://github.com/zixingjiang/zixingjiang.github.io) whenever a commit that modifies the TeX file is pushed to the main branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/zixingjiang/cv/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_publish.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date.
